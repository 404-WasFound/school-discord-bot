Each player takes on one of two rolesâ€”most are Crewmates, but a small number play Impostorsâ€”which does not alter their appearance. The goal of the Crewmates is to either identify and vote out the Impostors, or to complete all the tasks around the map; the goal of the Impostors is to covertly sabotage the mission either by killing the Crewmates before they complete all their tasks or by triggering a disaster that cannot be resolved.")
